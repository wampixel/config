#ClangAutoComplete
=================

Sublime Text 3 plugin that offers auto-completion of C/C++ structure members or class attributes and methods.

##Installation

1. Install "clang". Note that some people reported issue with clang 3.5.2 when compiled from Cygwin. If you are facing issues on Windows, try to download directly from the official [clang website](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).
2. Install from Package Control, or clone this repository and put it in your Sublime's packages directory to install from git.
3. Edit the settings to your needs (in menu `Preferences/Package Settings/ClaugAutoComplete/Settings`). On linux, it looks like clang is having trouble finding standard header files. Here are what I had to include in the plugin settings to make it work on my system.
        
 ```C
"include_dirs" : [
              "/usr/include/c++/4.4.7/",                      /* Where you find iostream, vector, etc. */
              "/usr/lib/clang/3.4.2/include",                 /* stdbool, etc */
              "/usr/include/c++/4.4.4/x86_64-redhat-linux/",  /* bits folder */
              "/usr/include",
 ```
 
 If you can't find the equivalent path try to search your system to find those key files and add the paths, i.e.
 
 ```bash
sudo find / -name "iostream"
sudo find / -name "stdbool.h"
sudo find / -name "c++config.h"
 ```
        
4. Make sure Sublime's own auto-complete settings are properly configured, I've had trouble with mine.
Here is my C.sublime-settings as an example


        {
                "auto_complete": true,
                "auto_complete_selector": "source - comment",
                "auto_complete_triggers":
                [
                        {
                                "characters": "."
                        },
                        {
                                "characters": ">"
                        },
                        {
                                "characters": ":"
                        },
                ],
                "extensions":
                [
                        "c",
                        "h"
                ]
        }


##Settings

 - include_dirs: List of directories where relevant header files are located
 - autocomplete_all: Trigger auto-completion on every keypress (will slow down sublime)
 - selectors: List of characters that will trigger auto-completion ( if "autocomplete_all" is set to "false" )
 - clang_binary: Location of clang binary (if it is not in the path)
 - You can copy the whole settings file under your project base folder named as ".clangautocomplete" to have the plugin load those instead of the general settings.
